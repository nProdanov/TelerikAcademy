XML is markup language which defines set of rules for threating data. XML is human readable. It's used for storing data with some info about the data.

XML namespaces are used to make difference between same-like elements. Example: If I have <table> with some context and <table> with another context, namespaces can help
to make difference between them. 
<root
xmlns:some="someURI"
xmlns:another="anotherURI">
    <some:table>
    </some:table>

    <another:table>
    </another:table>
</root>
